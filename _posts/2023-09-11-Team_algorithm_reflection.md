## Team teach reflection Algorithms

- A simulation, in context of computer science, is a digital representation of a situation in the real world.
- Examples:
    - Experiments: When an experiment is to dangerous to perform in the real world or too expensive, a simulation can be made of it and be performed digitally.
    - Training and Education: Simulations such as flight simulators and medical simulation can be very practical in aiding dangerous proffesions to receive training.
 
This was a great lesson it helped me learn the basic python to import dependencies and it also helped me learn how to define a function effectively as well as be able to call the function to use it later in the program.
