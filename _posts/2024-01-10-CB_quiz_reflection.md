QUESTION NUMBER 4
In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?

Responses
A: The program attempted to perform an operation that is considered an undecidable problem.

B: The precision of the result is limited due to the constraints of using a floating-point representation.

C: The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.

D: The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.

My original Answer: D
Correct Answer: C

- This was a question I struggled with as I had never heard of the term overflow error but from what it sounded like i thought it was  an error that means the program cannot represent integers. But I realised that while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not.

QUESTION NUMBER 23

My Original Answer: B
Correct Answer: D

- I put B thinking that this expression whenever the flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise. I then realised this expression would be equivalent to an algorithm that sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is at least 20. The algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be true in order to set available to true.


QUESTION NUMBER 67

My Original Answer: A
Correct Answer: A and B

- This issue was more of a rushed error on my end. I did not realise that there could be two options I rushed into it and realising that A was right I selected A without reading other options and also selecting B.
